# Malware-Analysis

# Overview
This repository contains malware analysis reports of various random samples obtained from MalwareBazaar. These reports are created as part of my journey to learn and improve my skills in malware analysis. Each report includes details such as the behavior, indicators of compromise (IOCs), static and dynamic analysis results, and insights gained during the process.

# Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning process and share insights with others interested in malware analysis. By analyzing different malware families and techniques, I aim to build a strong foundation in understanding malicious software and its impact on systems.

# Structure
Reports: Each analysis is stored in a dedicated folder, containing:

- Sample Overview: Basic information such as hash values, file type, and source.
- Static Analysis: Findings from inspecting the binary without execution.
- Dynamic Analysis: Results from executing the sample in a controlled environment.
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): Observations like network activity, dropped files, and registry changes.
- Summary and Insights: Lessons learned and key takeaways.
